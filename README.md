# Intro

This book contains notes I have taken while learning and practicing algorithm problems. Some of knowledge
is drawn from related books such as *Programing Pearls*, *Cracking the Coding Interview* and so on.
I will also put small, trivial but useful things occurred while solving an algorithm problem in the book.

The notes will be separated in three main parts:

1. **[Useful knowledge](useful_knowledge/README.md)** are notes of knowledge that has been summerized, 
   abstracted and categorized from books or the Internet.
2. **[Problem Solutions](problem_solutions/README.md)** contains solutions on problems. These problems may comes from
   [LeetCode](http://leetcode.com), [TopCoder](http://topcoder.com) and many other sites.
3. **[Other Things](http://other_things/README.md)** are things not so related to algorithm but I think will also 
   be useful for a coding interview (especially English coding interview).

Please notice that this book is still **under construction**. I intend to finish this book in 4 or 5 months.
